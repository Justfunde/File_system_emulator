# File_system_emulator
The File System Emulator (FSE) simulates the details of creating, deleting, copying, and moving files and directories. It also handles commands related to file system management. FSE must be able to read and execute batch files with file system management commands. After executing (or while executing) the batch file, FSE should output the resulting directory structure in formatted form to the console and, if an error is found, an error message. Attention! - the program should not do anything with the real file system on the disk - it should just simulate the operation of the file system in memory.
